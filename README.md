# Overview
A simple threejs platformer videogame including key controls, sound design, CSS-only background effects, and practical lighting. Branded using Google's color profile. 

For novice developers like myself, clone the repo and look into the threejs code in main.js. 

Shoutout to https://github.com/christopher4lis for his incredible course.
